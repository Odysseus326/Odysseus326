- 👋 Hi, I’m @Odysseus326 (Evan)
- 👀 I’m a musician who has recently gotten really into programming.
- 🌱 I’m improving my ability to program on many different technologies (both front-end and back-end) with the many resources available online.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get a job within the software development field soon.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on here!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I actually have two AAs, one in music (I'm an avid percussion performer & teacher), and another in science.
                Originally i was pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, but stopped once I realized it isn't necessary
                to enter the industry. Once I learned that, I decided the degree wasn't worth it. Maybe I'll continue pursuing it one day
                (just for the piece of paper) but probably after I get a stable job within the industry
