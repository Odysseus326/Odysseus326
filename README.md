My name is Evan, I'm a software developer and an active musical performer and teacher in percussion. I have an AA for each.

- ✨ I recently finished building my [personal website](https://evanbrentson.com/). Its very interactive and you can find the code for it [here](https://github.com/Odysseus326/evan-brentson-website).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud deployment and the nitty-gritty of full-stack development.
- ⚡ I'm working on my dream project [website](https://github.com/Odysseus326/music-education-site) designed to connect music educators with aspiring students.
- 💞️ I’m always open to opportunities to learn and grow.
